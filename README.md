## Documentation

Upon launching the application a user will be asked to login before proceeding.
![login](https://github.com/gwalahad/cushontask/blob/main/docimages/login.pngraw=true)

After logging in, the user is redirected to their account overview page.
Here you can see the name of the user logged in, along with the uninvested balance, the type of ISA product they are viewing & any investments should they exist. You can also initiate a new investment from here.
![account](https://github.com/gwalahad/cushontask/blob/main/docimages/account1.png?raw=true)

The new investment screen lists the funds available to the user at this time.
They can specify how much to invest, with a minimum of Â£1 and a maximum of their unused balance displayed on the previous page.
![investment](https://github.com/gwalahad/cushontask/blob/main/docimages/invest.png?raw=true)

- Front end improvements to the UI, possibly using a mdoern framework such as react.js or vue.js.
